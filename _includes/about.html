          With a recently completed Master's in Data Science from City, University of London—earned with distinction—he brings together academic excellence and practical experience in data management.
          
          For his dissertation, he handled a dataset of over 400,000 records using Google Colab while carefully applying the same step-by-step process to 24 models using Python. This work showed his 
          skill with data analysis, feature selection, and engineering. Importantly, his research followed international regulatory frameworks and risk management best practices, including CRE36 and IRB standards.
          
          In his professional life, he thrives in fast-paced environments where his problem-solving abilities stand out. His flexibility is clear from his previous position, where he moved easily 
          between three different roles across different markets, while managing five weekly projects and three daily tasks. This exceptional work capacity led to impressive results—exceeding 
          assigned targets by seventeen times. Colleagues consistently describe him as an outstanding team player, highlighting his resourcefulness and communication skills.
